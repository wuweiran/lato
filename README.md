# History

This is a 2020 remake of the Game Alto's Adventure (2015), which was a remake of Ski Safari (2012). The first release of this game is in 2023.

'Lato' is the name of the main character and describes someone who is always 'late' and that's why he has to hurry.

Unfortunately none of the previous endless runner games was FLOSS. There was TredGamerZ/Legendary (2017), it was open source but still based on Unity. Unity is not open source. The corona SDK engine has been made open source in Jan 2019 and they got a show case example called Endless Sk8boarder, which looks like crap and doesn't do good marketing for the engine.

The day and night cycles of Alto's adventure have also been remade a few times - most prominently in the game Fishing Life in 2019. However Fishing Life was also made in Unity. Lato is the first release of these day and night cycles into the pen source world, to be reused in other projects.

The only suitable way around the restrictions of closed source games and engines was to use a well established and well supported FLOSS engine (LibGDX) to make a complete new endless runner game. Unfortunately many problems are also not resolved yet in LibGDX and yet have to be pioneered. That's what this project attempts. Bring a showcase app to the FLOSS community that provides an example implementation for:
* endless procedural random terrain
* 2D and 3D mixture
* realistic weather and day night cycles
* physics without physics engine (Box2D was possible over overkill, so it was removed in 8e059919b01a148cc3303734567100079ae2bb18)
* chained shaders
* Scene3D - likely the first working version at all (only implemented to the necessary extend)

in LIBGDX.
